Use of tensorflow for image classification and deployment on heroku from the flask framework

This is a personal project for the classification of the beers of the brewery of Burkina Faso. The idea is through a photo of the beer to automatically detect which beer it is. For this, we have collected images through google and other sites. Then I used a neural network designed from the Tensorflow Framework to train the model. And then a deployment on heroku of the Flask Framework.
