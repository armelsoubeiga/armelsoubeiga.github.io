I am R&D Machine Learning, GenAI Engineer at [Safran Aircraft Engines](https://www.safran-group.com/companies/safran-aircraft-engines), and a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Etis Laboratory](https://www.etis-lab.fr/). My background combines both academic and enterprise kills, at the intersection of applied artificial intelligence and fundamental research. I also have high programming skills. My work areas include:

- **GenAI and Multimodal LLM Agents** – Building AI agents based on multimodal LLMs, extracting information from multiple sources (.pdf, .xlsx, .docx, .pptx, .msg, image), developing RAG pipelines, fine-tuning, entity extraction (PromptNER), dynamic visualization with graph databases (Neo4j), and deploying agents on robust architectures (Langchain, AWS).

- **Uncertainty Quantification** – Developing unsupervised clustering approaches that integrate uncertainty, especially with evidential clustering models and multi-view evidential neural networks. A major focus is on quantifying uncertainty for medical image segmentation that combines multi-modal inputs (e.g. images and clinical reports) and multi-view representations.

- **Explainable AI** – Designing interpretable learning models and post-hoc analysis tools for algorithmic transparency, with a special focus on industrial time series data. Developing hybrid methods that combine statistical interpretability (inference, rules) and attribute-based explainability (SHAP, LIME). Exploring collaborative variable weighting mechanisms to improve model readability and support adoption in critical business environments.

I completed my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Clermont Auvergne, within the Doctoral School of Engineering Sciences, in collaboration with [LIMOS](https://limos.fr/) and [Simon Fraser University (SFU)](https://www.sfu.ca/), under the supervision of [Jonas KOKO](https://perso.isima.fr/~jokoko/), [Violaine ANTOINE](https://perso.isima.fr/~viantoin/), and [Sylvain MORENO](https://www.sfu.ca/siat/people/research-faculty/sylvain-moreno.html). My thesis focused on the development of unsupervised and interpretable clustering methods, with a particular emphasis on relational and multi-view evidential (uncertainty-based) clustering. I designed robust and explainable models that integrated variable weighting, post-hoc methods (such as SHAP), and association rules, with a strong orientation toward real-world applications and complex trajectories (categorical, discrete longitudinal, and time series data).

Before starting my PhD, I worked for three years as a data scientist at RCTs in Lyon, where I developed tools for analyzing care pathways using hard and fuzzy clustering techniques, dimensionality reduction, variable scoring, and interactive visualization. Before joining RCTs, I was a data analyst consultant for the World Bank in Burkina Faso.
