In April 2020 I completed the specialization **Tensorflow 2.0: Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence** by udemy.
In this specialization, I learned about :

* Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) / Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)
* Predict Stock Returns
* Time Series Forecasting
* Computer Vision
* How to build a Deep Reinforcement Learning Stock Trading Bot
* GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)
* Recommender Systems
* Image Recognition
* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
* Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
* Use Tensorflow Serving to serve your model using a RESTful API
* Use Tensorflow Lite to export your model for mobile (Android, iOS) and embedded devices
* Use Tensorflow's Distribution Strategies to parallelize learning
* Low-level Tensorflow, gradient tape, and how to build your own custom models
* Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Deep Learning
* Demonstrate Moore's Law using Code
* Transfer Learning to create state-of-the-art image classifiers
