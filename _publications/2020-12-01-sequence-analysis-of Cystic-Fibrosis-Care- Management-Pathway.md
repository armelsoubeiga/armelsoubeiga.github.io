## Abstract

Routine management of cystic fibrosis (CF) has recently turned a corner with an increase in ambulatory care, 
which would improve lifestyle and reduce in-hospital infections. Our objective was to cluster management patterns considering both chronology and 
places of care (ambulatory or in-hospital) through sequential analysis.
