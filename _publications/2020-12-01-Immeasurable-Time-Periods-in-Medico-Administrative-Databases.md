## Abstract

Medico-Administrative DataBases (MADBs) are an important tool in pharmacoepidemiology, 
for the study of drug exposure and its effects in real world. Among the bias arising from the use of MADBs, 
the ENCePP describes the Immeasurable Time Periods (ITP) due to hospitalizations as a main source of exposure misclassification with major consequences on 
the evaluation of drugs. To date, despite the increasing number of studies carried out using MADBs, the risk of bias associated with ITP is only rarely assessed. 
The objective of this study was to carry out a systematic review of the literature available on ITP in MADBs.
