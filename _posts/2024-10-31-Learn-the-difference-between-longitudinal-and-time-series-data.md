excerpt: "Longitudinal and time series data are confusing when it comes to analysing historical data. There are no strict and formal definitions on which a wide range of data analysts agree.
In the literature, we have noticed that there are very few articles on the subject. And the few articles that do mention it, skim over the definition"
